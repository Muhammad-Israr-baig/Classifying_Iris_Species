# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm 
— **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** —
to classify iris flowers into different species based on their **sepal** and **petal** dimensions.
--- ## 📘 Project Overview The **Iris dataset** is one of the most popular datasets in machine learning and pattern recognition.
In this notebook, we: 
- Load and explore the Iris dataset using scikit-learn. - Visualize the data using pandas and matplotlib. 
- Train a **KNN classifier** model. - Evaluate its accuracy and make predictions on new data.

 ⚙️ Requirements Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn mglearn

## 🧠 Core Concepts This project introduces several **fundamental machine learning and data science concepts** that form the basis for more advanced topics:
### 📊 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing - Loading and inspecting datasets using scikit-learn. - Converting data into pandas DataFrames for easy handling. - Understanding features (inputs) and labels (outputs). 
### 🧩 2. Data Visualization - Plotting relationships between features using **scatter matrix** plots. - Observing patterns and separability between classes.
### 🧮 3. Model Building with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Training the model with the KNeighborsClassifier from **scikit-learn**. - Learning how the KNN algorithm classifies data points based on proximity. 
### ⚙️ 4. Model Evaluation - Using a **train/test split** to evaluate model accuracy. - Understanding the difference between **training** and **testing** data. 
### 🔍 5. Making Predictions - Predicting new, unseen data points. - Mapping numerical predictions to **class labels** (like *setosa*, *versicolor*, *virginica*). 
### 🧠 6. Key Machine Learning Skills Practiced - Working with datasets in numpy and pandas - Building and training ML models using scikit-learn - Visualizing and interpreting model performance ---
